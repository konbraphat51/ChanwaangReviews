## Motivation

### AD

AD has impared...

- episodic memory
- semantic memory
- visuospatial ability

We should train this + working memory (for transfer)

### CCT (Computerized Cognitive Training)

- better than other CT because it's home-based + individualized [18]

  - improve episodic memory + visuospatial ability [8]

- multi-domain CCT is better than single-domain CCT[19]
  - has beneficial effects on ...
    - global cognition
    - attention
    - working memory[11]
    - processing speed [12]
    - delayed recall[13]
