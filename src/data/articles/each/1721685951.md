## motivation
language understanding is important for...
- maintaining cognitive abilities (Manly et al., 2003; Stern, 2009; Payne et al., 2012a; Stine-Morrow et al., 2015).
- learning new information

Decline of **working memory** takes away language comprehension and use.  (Wingfield and Stine-Morrow, 2000; Wlotko et al., 2010; Payne and Stine-Morrow, 2016; Stine-Morrow and Payne, 2016).
-> limiting communicative compentence

### Working Memory
"the ability to temporarily store, maintain, and organize task-relevant information"  
-> "domain-general mechanism responsible for such age-related changes in language understanding" (Stine and Wingfield, 1987; Van der Linden et al., 1999; Borella et al., 2011; Kemper, 2012; Payne et al., 2014a).

### Verbal Working Memory
"verbal WM has been found to reliably mediate age-related changes in “off-line” measures of language comprehension and language memory"(Kwong See and Ryan, 1995; Van der Linden et al., 1999; Hertzog et al., 2003; DeDe et al., 2004; Stine-Morrow et al., 2008; Borella et al., 2011).

"sentence comprehension accuracy are larger for sentences that are more semantically or syntactically complex, and these differences in performance have been found to be dependent upon individual differences in **verbal WM capacity**"

WM capacity is predictor of resolution in ambiguities (Kemtes and Kemper, 1997; Kemper et al., 2004; Christianson et al., 2006) 

### Cognitive Training
There are a lot of variations

### This Study
test
- WM's plasticity
- Is WM capacity is critical for language comprehension?

Karbach et al. (2015) found that WM training improved language comprehension **but not** math performance or executive control (e.g., inhibition, task switching)
