# Introduction
## Ludology
“The interest towards gameplay itself” independent from media.

### ludus
“a set of defined rules”
- several narratives pop out as a result 
  - ludus is **active**
  - narrative is **passive**
- dividing between narrative and gameplay
    - gameplay was understood as narrative then

Juul(2001) “computer games’s strength is **not to story-tell**
    - game’s time differs from narrative
    - player and game-world relationship is different from narrative’s

Juul(2005) “Half Real”
- “videogames has 2 aspects: **rule** AND **fiction**”
- players understand game’s **fiction** world AND interact by **real rules** in the same time
- **The interaction between rules and fiction** is most important 
    - fiction improves understanding of rules
    - rules improves imagination of fiction 
    - this is **the core of fun**
- rule: from hardware to software
