## Eye tracking
### Fixation
- most research examined **fixation**
- for detailed process, visual field has twice the thumb at arm's length (Chandon et al. 2009)
  - Identify objects
  - extract detailed information
- effects downstream: (Orquin et al. 2013)
  - memory
  - preference
  - choice
  - sales

#### measures
- total duration
- count
- likelihood
- time to first fixation
- first fixation duration
- duration + visit duration

### Pulpil dilation
related to:
- mental workload (Hess et al. 1964)
- emotional arousal (Partala et al. 2003)
- attention (Laeng et al. 2012)
- memory
- sleepiness / fatigue

### blink rate
associated with:
- mental workload (Tsai et al. 2007)
- attention and emotion (Maffei et al. 2019)

## type of attention
### bottom-up attention
- stimulus-driven attention

### top-down attention
- goal-directed attention

## behaviour and choice
correlated with choice:
- total fixation
- dwell duration
- fixation count
- revisit count

no correlation with:
- time to first fixation
- first fixation duration
