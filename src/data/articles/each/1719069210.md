## Simplified LeDoux model

### Basics

```plantuml
@startuml

?-> Thalamus: Sensory input

hnote over Thalamus: Simple signal process

activate Thalamus

Thalamus -> LimbicSystem: Primitive emotions
Thalamus -> Cortex: Higher level processing

deactivate Thalamus

hnote over LimbicSystem: Evaluate need/goal relevance

activate LimbicSystem

LimbicSystem -> Body
hnote over Body: physiological response

LimbicSystem -> Cortex
hnote over Cortex: cognitive response

deactivate LimbicSystem

## Definitions

### Emotion

- reaction to events have to do with needs/goals/concerns
- Includes physiologinal, affective, behavioral, cognitive components

### Mood

- long-term affective state
- distinguished by its **object-directedness**
- biases experienced emotion
  - has cause or contribute to moods
- **Important** to consider biasing effects while **assessing**

### Sentiment

- Assigned properties of an object
- Observed by put an object in mind the check the affective response (Clore 1994)
- can persist forever
- **Critically importance** in HCI for users to return to the product
- could be proceedingly made by prior description / stereotype

### Primitive emotions

**evolutionary** significant emotion

### Secondary emotions

knowledge-based processed emotion

- have various level
- either conscious or unconscious

### Primitive-Secondary Combined emotions

initial primitive emotion recognized/reinforced by secondary emotion

## Emotion Models

### basic emotion model

- has basic list of emotions

  - others are combinations/categorizable

- Enable...
  - emotion is distinguishable, measurable
  - emotion is universal
  - emotion is recognizable for users

### Social constructivist model

- emotion is learned
- emotion is influenced by culture
- challenging to predict
