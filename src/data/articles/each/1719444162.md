## Why HTN?

### programmer's problem

Wants...

- better performance
- maintainability
- usability

> "It’s only after we implement those solutions that we understand some of the nuances that come with them."

## Algorithm

### World State

> "A vector of properties that describe what out HTN is going to reason about"

### Sensors

update world state vector

### Tasks

two types:

- compound tasks
- primitive tasks

#### Primitive Tasks

Primitive tasks that can be executed by the NPC

Composed of:

- an operator
- sets of effects
- conditions

##### Condition

- If true, task executed.
- Not required
- recommended to reduce redundancy of checks in higher level tasks

##### Effect

- Describe the **result** of the task
- allows the HTN to expect future

##### Operator

- represents an atomic action NPC does

#### Compound Tasks

- high level task that has **multiple** ways to be achieved
- need to select the right **method**

##### method

a set of:

- conditions

  - validated against **world state**

- tasks
  - set of tasks, or subtasks.
    - **subtasks** is comprised of primitive / compound tasks
  - represent the approach

### plan

set of primitive tasks

### HTN Domain

- Entire task hierarchy
- essentially a tree structure
- Has **root** compound task = final goal

### Planning

#### condition

Conditions to tart finding a new plan:

- finishes/fails the current plan
- doesn't have a plan
- world state changes

#### flow

Initialization:

- Push **root task** to `TaskToProcess` stack
- Planner creates copy of world state
  - -> **working world state**  
    Simulate the consequences of the plan

Iterate on the tasks, until `TaskToProcess` stack is empty:

- Pop task from `TaskToProcess` stack
- if compound task
  - decompose
    - Search methods that **first conditions** are valid
    - If found, the method's tasks are pushed to `TaskToProcess` stack
    - If not found, roll back to the **last** compound task that was **decomposed**
- if primitive task
  - check conditions against **working world state**
    - if true, add to the **final** plan and **effect** applied to **working world state**
    - if false, planner's state is rolled back to the **last** compound task that was **decomposed**

Result:

- list of primitive tasks
- OR rolled back enought to fail (no plan)
