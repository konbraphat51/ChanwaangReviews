## Why HTN?

### programmer's problem

Wants...

- better performance
- maintainability
- usability

> "It’s only after we implement those solutions that we understand some of the nuances that come with them."

## Algorithm

### World State

> "A vector of properties that describe what out HTN is going to reason about"

### Sensors

update world state vector

### Tasks

two types:

- compound tasks
- primitive tasks

#### Primitive Tasks

Primitive tasks that can be executed by the NPC

Composed of:

- an operator
- sets of effects
- conditions

##### Condition

- If true, task executed.
- Not required
- recommended to reduce redundancy of checks in higher level tasks

##### Effect

- Describe the **result** of the task
- allows the HTN to expect future

##### Operator

- represents an atomic action NPC does

#### Compound Tasks

- high level task that has **multiple** ways to be achieved
- need to select the right **method**

##### method

a set of:

- conditions

  - validated against **world state**

- tasks
  - set of tasks, or subtasks.
    - **subtasks** is comprised of primitive / compound tasks
  - represent the approach

### plan

set of primitive tasks
