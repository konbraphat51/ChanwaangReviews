## abstract
review:
- different data type of eye-tracking for retailing research
- understanding real-world complexity
- good example for field studies

show:
- guidelines for executing eyetracking research

## introduction
### traditional ways
- tracking shopper by notes
- shoppers self-report
- CCTV
- handcams / headcams
- RFID in shopping carts

#### problems
- cannot know what shoppers exactly looking at (price tag? package?)


### eye tracking
tracks shoppers focus 
-> "overcomes many limitations of traditional tracking methods" (Grewal et al. 2020)

#### metrics
- first fixation
- number of fixation
- length in time of the fixations
- length of the saccades = distance between fixations
- scan path

**without interfering with the shoppers natural behaviours**

#### higher level
only eye tracking data is **insufficient**

important to understand **upstream process** = visual **perception** (!= attention)

in-store decisions conposed of:
- stimulus input
- memory retrieval

same eye movement can have different interpretation (memory vs. external stimulus factor)

eye tracking **need combination of another data**
