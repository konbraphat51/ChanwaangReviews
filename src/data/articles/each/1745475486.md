## 3. Content-Based; model-based
- **user profile**
  - learned ML model by user preference data
- rule-based classifier
  - can be simplified by **association rule mining**
    - Association rule has a **confidence**
  - Recommendation score is a weighted (by confidence) average of firing of the association rule
- naive Bayes classifier
  - compare the greater/less of
    - possibility of like: $P(R=1)\prod_{ k = 1 }^d P(X_k=x_{i,k}|R=+1)$
    - possibility of dislike: $P(R=-1)\prod_{ k = 1 }^d P(X_k=x_{i,k}|R=-1)$
  - zero frequency problem
    - Laplacian smoothing
- decision tree
