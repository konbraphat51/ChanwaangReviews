## Abstract

1. choose right in-game challenges
1. design appropriate interaction mechanism for cognitively impareds
1. implement AI for provide adequate prompts and dynamic difficulty adjustment
1. produce effective visual & auditory assets to maximize cognitive training

## motivation

- videogame is less expensive and more accessible
- Nintendo's games provides **only memory challenges** and **random puzzles**

  - not really suit perceptual and interaction needs for Alzheimer's patients
  - no in-game assistance for recognize cognitive errors
  - no dynamic difficulty adjustment
  - artistic design are not suited for cognitively-impaired

- [12]need training of...
  - memory
  - planning
  - initiative
  - perseverance

## Choose right in-game challenges

### Keep Trace of the Patient’s Cognitive Abilities

want in-game estimation of patient's cognitive abilities
<- Naturalistic Action Test

### Determine an Appropriate Number of Steps for the Challenges

- Too much steps could overload the patients
- should be 8-12 steps

### Keep the Player in his “Flow Zone”

- **Flow** = feeling of complete and focus in an activity

- AD patients has difficulty to learn new paradigms
- The game must e straightforward and intuitive
  - -> recreating well-known activities
