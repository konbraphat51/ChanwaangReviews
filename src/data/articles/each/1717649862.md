## Onion Architecture
**Depend on the stabler module!!**

1. Domain Model  
The essence never changes. Depends only on programming language and library.

2. Usecase  
What user want to do

3. Interface/Adapter  
Convert domain data structure to data available for computer handling

4. Infrastructure  
Give each modules a closed role and connect to the outside of the package.

## Package Principles
* REP = Reuse-Release Equivalent Principle  
再利用・リリース等価の原則  
Reuse what only released. If you want to reused your program, release (give stability to) it.

* CRP = Common Reuse Principle  
全利用の原則  
Reuse all of the code in the package. (Don't stuff too much into the package.)

* CCP = Common Closure Principle  
閉鎖性共通の原則  
One changes, One package swap

* ADP = Acyclic Dependencies Principle  
非循環依存関係の原則  
No cyclic dependencies (Make them to a single package)

* SDP = Stable Dependencies Principle  
安定依存の原則  
**Always** depend on stabler package

* SAP = Stable Abstractions Principle  
安定度・抽象度等価の原則  
Stability = Abstraction Degree (interface / no concrete details / generality / programming language itself)
