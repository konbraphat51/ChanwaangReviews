## Self-Determination Theory

- SDT has many empirical propositions

## Need Satisfaction

- **BPNT = Basic Psychological Needs Theory**

  - **Competence**: "the feeling of having an effect"
  - **Autonomy**: "a sense that actions are self-endorsed and performed willingly"
  - **Relatedness**: "a sense of reciprocal care, value, and belonging in relation to other social figures and collectives"

- **Need Frustration**

  - when feel active interruption for basic needs
    - feeling incapable, controlled, interrupted by others
  - Negative psychological outcomes more effectively than need satisfaction

- **PENS = Player Experience of Need Satisfaction**

  - index of need satisfaction in games
  - have 5 subscales

    - **Competence**
    - **Autonomy**
    - **Relatedness**
    - **Presence/Immersion**
    - **Intuitive Controls**

  - there is Ubisoft Perceived Experience Questionnaire (UPEQ)

- **Need Density Hypothesis**

  - individual which han no daily satisfaction wants...

    - dense
    - consistent
    - immediate

    experience in gameplay

## Motivation

- energy to take action, and direction of the energy

- **CET = Cognitive Evaluation Theory**

  - **Intrinsic Motivation**: doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable
  - **Extrinsic Motivation**: doing something because it leads to a separable outcome

  - **Undermining Effect**: extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation
